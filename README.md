# Call Center Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview
This Excel project shows how I analyzed real call center data to help businesses make better decisions. Using data from an entire year (2023), I created interactive dashboards and charts to uncover patterns in customer calls across three regions: Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati. This project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, Excel, and turning numbers into useful business insights.

## Business Problem
Call centers need to understand their data to work better and make customers happy. This project answers important questions like:
- When do we get the most calls, and how many staff do we need?
- Which locations and employees are doing the best job?
- Do men and women call at different times or for different reasons?
- What problems can we fix to work more efficiently?
